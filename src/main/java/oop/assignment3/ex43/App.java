Programming languages can create files and folders too.

Create a program that generates a website skeleton with the following specifications:

Prompt for the name of the site.
Prompt for the author of the site.
Ask if the user wants a folder for JavaScript files.
Ask if the user wants a folder for CSS files.
Generate an index.html file that contains the name of the site
inside the <title> tag and the author in a <meta> tag.

Example Output
Site name: awesomeco
Author: Max Power
Do you want a folder for JavaScript? y
Do you want a folder for CSS? y
Created ./website/awesomeco
Created ./website/awesomeco/index.html
Created ./website/awesomeco/js/
Created ./website/awesomeco/css/

The user should then find these files and directories created in the working directory of your program.
