/*
Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for
creating word clouds and other types of word analysis. And itâ€™s more useful when running it against lots of text.

Create a program that reads in a file named `exercise46_input.txt` and counts
the frequency of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency,
and display the histogram to the screen.

Example Output
Given the text file `exercise46_input.txt` with this content

badger badger badger
badger mushroom
mushroom snake badger badger
badger

the program would produce the following output:

badger:   *******
mushroom: **
snake:    *
Constraint
Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report and the least used words are at the bottom.
